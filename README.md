# Add-User-Notifier

This is a mini-project to learn implementation and usage of Web Sockets in Django using Django-Channels.

## Features - 

* <b>_Add User Notifier_</b> - A notification is displayed (as list item) whenever a new user is created. Corresponding consumer is _NoseyConsumer_.

* <b>_Tick Tock_</b> - A 'tick' and '...tock' log is generated every second. Corresponding consumer is _TickTockConsumer_.

* <b>_Echo_</b> - An echo of a message sent is displayed as log. Corresponding consumer is _EchoConsumer_.

#### Note - 
* Currently only 'Add User Notifier' is functional as other two functionalities(Tick Tock and Echo) were built in the learning process to eventually build 'Add User Notifier'.
* Refer to _requirements.txt_ for dependencies used. Additionaly, _redis_ was also installed.
